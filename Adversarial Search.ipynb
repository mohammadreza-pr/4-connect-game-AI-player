For the first player you must create the minimax tree until you reach a terminal node(a state which a player has won or their is a draw) or a cutoff state. Then you must use an evaluation function to score the leafs and find the next best move. For the second player you must do all the above however when you are playing as max their is a probability that you will choose a random move instead of the best move.  \n",
    "2 - Implement the evaluation function in _Board.py_. Since we can't create the full game tree we need some sort of scoring function to differentiate between states. For example we can count the pieces in each row and column that are neighbours. better evaluation function will lead to a better minimax player.\n",
